An advanced hybrid recommendation system for predicting movie ratings. It combines collaborative filtering techniques, such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and KNNWithMeans, with metadata-based features. User metadata, including age and gender, and movie metadata, such as release year and derived statistics, are processed through feature engineering, scaling, and encoding to enrich the dataset.

The system optimizes collaborative filtering algorithms using grid search to find the best hyperparameters. It evaluates performance with metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Predictions are generated for unseen data and saved for leaderboard evaluation, showcasing the modelâ€™s applicability to real-world recommendation tasks.
