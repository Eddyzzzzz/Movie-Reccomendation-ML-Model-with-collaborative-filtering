# Movie-Reccomendation-ML-Model-with-collaborative-filtering

This project implements an **advanced hybrid recommendation system** to predict movie ratings by combining **collaborative filtering** and **metadata-based features**.  

**Project Documentation:** [Movie Rec Model](https://narrow-theory-18d.notion.site/Movie-Rec-Model-1b9436c3d41a81fdb70fe6ff1606080f?pvs=74)  

## Key Features  
- **Collaborative Filtering** – Uses **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** and **KNNWithMeans**.  
- **Metadata-Based Features** – Incorporates user (age, gender) and movie (release year, statistics) data.  
- **Feature Engineering** – Scaling, encoding, and enrichment for better predictions.  
- **Hyperparameter Optimization** – Uses **grid search** to fine-tune models.  
- **Performance Evaluation** – Assessed using **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** and **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**.  
- **Leaderboard Predictions** – Generates and saves unseen data predictions for evaluation.  

## How It Works  
1. **Preprocess Data** – Perform feature engineering and encoding.  
2. **Train Models** – Optimize collaborative filtering algorithms.  
3. **Evaluate Performance** – Measure accuracy with MAE and RMSE.  
4. **Generate Predictions** – Apply the trained model to unseen data.
